## ‚ö°Ô∏è Fun Fact About My GitHub
You might notice that this GitHub account is relatively new compared to my journey in software engineering. That's because I first created my GitHub account using my **company email** while working at **Leapfrog Technology**. Now, at **Ozdocs Group of Companies**, we use **Bitbucket** for version control. 

However, this profile is where I share all my **self-learning projects**, which I work on in my free time after my full-time **Masters studies** and professional work as a **Software Engineer**. These projects are a reflection of my passion for continuous learning and improving my craft. üöÄ

Every repo here is **self-initiated**, whether it's a new tech stack I'm experimenting with or a personal project I believe will challenge me. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow. üíª‚ú®
